# Project 1
Here under the templates I have created 4 .html files for the frondend:
Registration File for registration page
Login for Login Page
Home is for Book Search and also a with logout button
Book_details is for the result of search which will show book details

Then in routes.py file, I have created routes for these pages, what this code is doing is:
1. It has app initalization
2. Creating a database connection
3. Setting a route for registration
4. Checks id password and confirmation matches
5. Checks if user already exists
6. Setting a route for login
7. Setting a route for Home page
8. Setting a route for Book_details page
9. Setting a route for logout

Then we have import.py file
In this file I have created databse connection
Then wrote a code to create a table
It reads data from csv file (books.csv) and insert into database
